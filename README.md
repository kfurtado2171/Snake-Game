# Snake-Game

### Description
This repository contains a version of Snake 
created for our CIS 602 final project. We added 
new features to the base game and expanded on 
it for the purposes of further learning software 
testing.

For this project we added:
* 'Game Over' screen
* 'Start' menu
* Difficulty selection
* Score Tracker
* Ability to change the snake's color
* Background music
* Sound effects


### Usage
In order to run play the game, you need to simply
download the HTML and JavaScript files onto your
device and ensure they are in the same directory.
From there, simply open the HTML file in a browser
of your choice to begin playing.

#### Start Screen
The game has a 'Start' screen, from which the
player may select 'Play,' change the difficult, 
or change the color of the snake.

#### Playing the Game
Once the player selects 'Play,' they game will begin.
The player can only turn 90 degrees from their current
direction of movement. Just like in any other
version of snake, if you move the snake's head into
one of the red pixels, the snake grows larger and 
the player gains a point. 

#### Game Over
If at any point the snake
collides with the edges of the area or itself, the
game will end. The end screen has two options: 'Restart,' which will
start the game over again, or 'Main Menu,' which will
the player back to the 'Start' screen
